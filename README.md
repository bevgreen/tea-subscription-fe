#  ðŸ«– Kettle On Tea Subscription ðŸ«–

## Overview

Kettle On Tea Subscription is an easy-to-use mock e-commerce interface for users to view tea subscriptions. At the top of the page there is a filter option where a user can select a tea name and see the subscriptions that include that tea. These tea subscriptions have viewable details like pricing, delivery frequency, teas included in the box, and the list of customers who have purchased previously. A user is able to activate and inactivate customer subscriptions (if it were an actual e-commerce website this would be a view only the site manager or developer can see).
